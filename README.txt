A small community focued website for Peterlee Chess Club.

Website was built using pure html5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

Website designed and built by Rainbowe Developments (Chris Bowe).  If you are looking for a small
website for a local business/charity/club, please check out my wesbite at XXXXXXXXX.XXXX.com

I started out building little 2D games with Phaser 3 and little web games in HTML for my daughter and
realised how much I enjoyed doing this.  Far from a designer or developer by trade, I'd be happy to let 
you know if I think I can help you out or not.  My skillset is developing all the time and if there is 
something I can't do I'll either learn it to get your project finished, or I'll be straight up if it is 
beyond my skillset.
